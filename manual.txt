-- Mouse cam
To use: enable checkbox "mouse cam" (default on)
Hold right click and move mouse to rotate around center. Scroll to zoom in on center.


-- STORE AND LOAD
store: will store de current channeldata to a file channels.txt in de current directory
load: will load channeldata from a file channels.txt. File has to be in the same directory as executable
reset: remove all channels

-- PLAYBACK
Press "Start" and the animation will begin and "Stop" to stop the animation.
Next to the start button is a counter for the current frame. Frame counter can be changed by clicking and dragging.
Playback works only for the following channels:
- step_ahead
- virtual_camera

-- Add channel
Click the "Add" button to add a channel with the current channels settings next to the button. 
Click button "virtual_camera" to change channel type.
Change channelname with inputfield. Giving a channelname is optional.

--- Channels:
-- Virtual camera
This channel creates a virtual camera path during the animation using keyframes. 
Between keyframes a hermite curve is used as path.

To change perspective to the camera of this channel:
- "mouse cam" checkbox at the top needs to be off.
- "enabled" checkbox for the channel needs to be on.
- No other camera channel has the enabled checkbox on.

add a keyframe to the channel by choosing a frame with the drag input and pressing "Add frame".
Only 1 keyframe per frame is possible. Click a keyframe to view it. Following options will appear:
- Camera position: change the camera position of the keyframe
- Camera rotation: change the camera rotation of the keyframe
- Ease in: if checked, the will be an ease in from last frame to this frame
- Ease out: if checked, the will be an ease out from last frame to this frame
- Control 1: start point tangent for the hermite curve path from last frame to this frame
- Control 2: end point tangent for the hermite curve path from last frame to this frame
- delete: delete this keyframe

-- Background
Adds a skybox to the scene. Skybox can be changed by changing the "path" variable. 
At the "path" location skybox files need to be split in: top.jpg, bottom.jpg, back.jpg, front.jpg, left.jpg, right.jpg

-- Step ahead
This channel allows for freefrom deformation on an rectangle. 
There are 8 control points and interpolation is used between keyframes.

Adding keyframes is the same as virtual camera. Clicking a keyframe gives options:
Object position: change the position of the object
Objection rotation: change the rotation of the object
C(0-7): change the position of the control point.

-- Character animation
This channels gives a skeleton and animates it with inverse kinematics.
By checking the box "IK active", the left hand of the skeleton wil move to the box position using inverse kinematics.
Box position and rotation can be changed. Skeleton position and scale can be changed.

-- Special effect
This channels give a long rectangle as surface. Above the surface paritcles will spawn. 
Particles will move to the right with a constant speed. 
Once particles hit the surface, particle-plane colision is used to calc new speed en direction.

Options:
- particle size: size of a paricle
- min size: size the particle will have at the end of its life
- spawn time: how often new particles are spawned
- max particles: maximum amount of particles at any time
- spawn per time: amount of particles spawned once it is time to spawn new ones
- time to live: lifetime of a particle in seconds
